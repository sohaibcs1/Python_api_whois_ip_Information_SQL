If someone obtains your IP address, they can discover a little bit about your internet service, such as which provider you use to connect to the internet, but they cannot locate you, your home, or your business.

<br/>
<h1>I build a Python API that gives the details of your Ip address and save it in MySQL. </h1>

the details contain:
Country, Region, City.
Longitude & Latitude: GPS
ISP Provider
Company and Organization Name
Postal or ZIP code
